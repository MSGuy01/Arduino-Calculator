# Arduino-Calculator
A calculator created with Arduino Uno which can add and subtract numbers. To use it, first build the circuit by looking at the "Calculator Model" image, then follow these instructions:
# Usage
The first thing that should show up on the LCD screen is "enter first num". Enter the number by pressing the first button to add one number, and the second to subtract one number. When you are finished with your first number, press the third button to change to the second number. Repeat the process with the second number. When you are finished, press the fourth button to see the result, and press the fifth button to start over. To subtract a number, just make the second number negative. 
# Note
When I created this, I had a limited number of buttons (5) and a limited number of pins (13) because I have an Arduino Uno, so some features I wish I could have added are not in this calculator. If I ever get an Arduino Mega and more buttons, I will probably make an updated version of this circuit with more functions.
